# Hunter-Mod

What does this mod do?

This mod adds an entity called the Hunter. The Hunter spawns naturally in all the Jungle Biomes above sea level. The Hunter fires Hunter Arrows which give the target the poison and glowing effect. To get these new arrows you have to kill a Hunter and it will drop them at the same rate of normal Arrows from Skeletons. The Hunter's Bow is also enchanted with Power lvl. I and Punch lvl. I.
